            "abstract":"cute inflammation constitutes host defense against tissue injury by ischemia, trauma, chemical toxins, extreme heat\n\nor cold, and radiant energy.  In addition, acute inflammation is a crucial host-protective response toward infection\n\nby extracellular bacteria.  Defense mechanisms of acute inflammation are mobilized within minutes, and consist of\n\nwhite blood cells (polymorphonuclear neutrophils) and plasma proteins (complement).  Acute inflammation is\n\neffective toward unencapsulated extracellular bacteria in the absence of specific immunity.  However, humoral\n\nimmunity with production of opsonizing antibody is required for the phagocytosis and killing of encapsulated\n\nextracellular bacteria by neutrophils.\n\n\n\nPersistence of tissue injury or infection by intracellular bacteria or viruses stimulates a chronic inflammatory\n\nresponse composed of macrophages and lymphocytes.  Macrophages serve as target cells for infection by many\n\nintracellular bacteria.  In the absence of immunity, actively mobile infected macrophages result in widespread\n\ndissemination of intracellular bacteria in the host.  However, antigen-specific stimulation of lymphocytes produces\n\ncytokines that activate infected macrophages for microbial killing.  Viruses infect a wide variety of cell types, and\n\nimmunity generates cytotoxic lymphocytes that destroy viral-infected host cells.\n\n\n\nChronic inflammation injures tissue by proteases and oxygen radicals released from neutrophils and macrophages.\n\nTissue necrosis stimulates the growth of capillaries (angiogenesis) and fibroblasts (granulation tissue), and results in\n\nthe formation of scar tissue.\n\n\n\nSystemic reactions develop in inflammation, and can be beneficial or injurious depending on the setting in which\n\nthey occur.  Systemic reactions of inflammation reflect macrophage activation with secretion of interleukin (IL)-1\n\nand tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?.  These inflammatory cytokines stimulate fever, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and hepatic synthesis of acute phase proteins.\n\n\n\nLECTURE GOALS-what you should learn from these lectures\n\n\u2022 Roles of chemical mediators in the inflammatory response.\n\n\u2022 Leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis in inflammation, and molecular mechanisms underlying these responses.\n\n\u2022 Oxygen-dependent microbial killing mechanisms in polymorphonuclear neutrophils.\n\n\u2022 Mechanisms of humoral immunity that contain infection by extracellular bacteria.\n\n\u2022 How tissue necrosis develops in chronic inflammation.\n\n\u2022 Nitric oxide-dependent microbial killing mechanisms in activated macrophages.\n\n\u2022 Mechanisms of cellular immunity that contain infection by intracellular bacteria and viruses.\n\n\u2022 Acute phase reactions in systemic inflammatory responses, and how they protect the host in infectious disease.\n\n\u2022 Mechanisms of repair by regeneration or connective tissue replacement, and roles of each in tissue repair during\n\nchronic inflammation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
